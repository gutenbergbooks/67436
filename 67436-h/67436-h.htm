<p class="indent"><b>Autumn Leaves</b> was in the hands of the Publisher (<span class="smcap">Bruce
Brough</span>) at the time of the Great Fire of April, 1906, and not a
single page of the original manuscript was saved. I could only recall a
few titles, and a line or two here and there, not knowing though where
they belonged. I began to rewrite on the 12th of June, 1908, and on the
12th of September, 1908, it was ready for publication. It has given
<em>me</em> new courage, and by searching, perhaps <em>you</em> may find
one leaf among my <b>Autumn Leaves</b> that you will feel was painted
expressly for you, and is worthy to be pressed upon the tablet of your
heart.</p>

<p>Who ever watched with loving care<br />

And pitfalls that are e’er in life;<br />

The autumn leaves are like our lives,<br />

They then return to mother Earth:<br />

The trees are gaunt, gaunt sentinels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deprived of their warm dress.</span><br />
They shiver in their nakedness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And moan in their distress.</span><br />
<br />
But, as with us, they live again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Again have garments fresh and new,</span><br />
And though they seem to die to earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Again their lives renew.</span><br />
<br />
Again the joy of living comes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brighter now is their new life;</span><br />
They had a season of sweet sleep,<br />

Naught seems strange, our dress is moonlight;<br />

Stars, and planets, are our footstools<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the dreamland of the soul.</span><br />

Butterflies are our companions,<br />

Chariots are common waggons,<br />

My powder-horn empty, on high it is hung.<br />
Come back to the forest where we’ve wandered alone;<br />
Come back to my wigwam, and I will condone<br />
<br />
The sin of thy leaving, for thou didst not know<br />
The wiles that the white man around thee couldst throw.<br />
The white man will tire of thy beauty so rare,<br />
His plaything thou’lt be, O Winona beware!<br />

Return to thy lover before ’tis too late&mdash;<br />
The love of an Indian is as strong as his hate.<br />
Winona! Winona! this is my last plea!<br />
Return unto me! O return unto me!<br />

Oswega! Oswega! I’ll listen to thee&mdash;<br />
Return to thee gladly, again will be free.<br />
’Tis true, for a moment, the glitter of gold<br />
Enticed my vain heart from my lover of old.<br />
<br />
The white man so subtile flattered my pride&mdash;<br />
He promised me honor for aye by his side.<br />
I loved him not ever, ’twas only my pride<br />

<br />
Oswega! Oswega! my heart is as true<br />
As thine is for me, and I bitterly rue<br />
That vanity caused my heart to grow cold,<br />
By flattering words and the glamour of gold.<br />
<br />
The dream is now o’er, it was but for a day.<br />
My vain heart was flattered, I could not say nay.<br />
My beauty may fade, but I know that thy heart<br />
Will ever be mine, and ne’er more shall we part.<br />

<p>
Beneath the placid waters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lily bulb had birth;</span><br />
It slept in sweet reliance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In arms of mother earth.</span><br />
<br />
In home beneath the waters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It slept in calm repose;</span><br />
With sweetness of the lily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beauty of the rose.</span><br />
<br />
One morn the Sun looked downward,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And loving words he spake.</span><br />
The lily bulb awakened<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From dreams, beneath the lake.</span><br />
<br />
A little bud shot upward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet the sun-god’s call,</span><br />
It sent forth all its fragrance<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its lover to enthrall.</span><br />
<br />
It sprang from out the waters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And donned its pure white gown.</span><br />
No sin defiled its beauty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its virtue was its crown.</span><br />
<br />
The little bud then blossomed,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So fragrant, pure and sweet,</span><br />
The air was filled with fragrance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many stopped to greet</span><br />
<br />
The pure white lily blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That on the water lay;</span><br />
A ruthless hand then plucked it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But threw it soon away.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
It faded, and then withered;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The earth was not its home;</span><br />
It missed the sparkling water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor wished from it to roam</span>

Upon life’s turbid waters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A human flower was born.</span><br />
As pure as water-lily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With beauty of the dawn.</span><br />
<br />
’Twas in a vine-clad cottage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close by the lily’s home;</span><br />
Where dwelt this pure young maiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor wished she e’er to roam.</span><br />
<br />
To her there came a lover&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But soon he cast aside</span><br />
The crushed and faded blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who was his promised bride.</span>

<hr class="tb" />

In lone, and dreary hovel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A weeping woman lay.</span><br />
No loving hand to tend her,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And naught but shadows gray.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
She sinned in loving, trusting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what was her reward?</span><br />
Dishonored, and forsaken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No friend had she but God.</span><br />
<br />
And in this lonely hovel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little child was born.&mdash;</span><br />
A little human lily<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First saw the light of dawn.</span><br />
<br />
Unheralded its coming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unwelcome was its birth.</span><br />
This little human lily<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was born from out the earth.</span><br />
<br />
It came without love’s greeting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its death caused not one tear;</span><br />
’Twas born into conditions<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That cost its mother dear.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
This child was pure and holy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though it was born of sin.&mdash;</span><br />
Its heavenly father loved it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So took it from the din</span><br />
<br />
Of earthly cares and sorrows.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took the mother too.</span><br />
The child is with her sleeping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No tears their grave bedew.</span><br />
<br />
Together in one coffin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The human lilies lie;</span><br />
Dishonored, and forsaken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They blossomed but to die.</span><br />
<br />
They lie upon the hillside.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some pitying hand now gave</span><br />
A pure, white lily blossom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To deck the outcasts’ grave.</span><br />

<p>
Beneath the wave tossed waters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the ocean bed;</span><br />
There dwelt a water spirit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To sea-king she was wed.</span><br />
<br />
Years passed in happy wedlock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pledges to them came</span><br />
Of love beneath the ocean;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For love is e’er the same.</span><br />
<br />
They lived in sweet communion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among their sea-weed flowers.</span><br />
’Twas ever peace and gladness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within their love-lit bowers.</span><br />
<br />
One little spirit wandering<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away from childhood’s home&mdash;</span><br />
Came into unknown waters,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath a coral dome,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
She heard a spirit teaching<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A doctrine, new and strange;</span><br />
She listened to his preaching,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thought took wider range.</span><br />
<br />
He told of other peoples<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who lived above the sea.</span><br />
Of birds with brilliant plumage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who in the air were free.</span><br />
<br />
To her this was awakening<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From out a long, long sleep.</span><br />
The soul was stirred within her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To flowers of thought most deep.</span><br />
<br />
Now to her home returning&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dissension there arose;</span><br />
Her former friends so loving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were now her bitter foes.</span><br />
<br />
They cried to her “O heretic!”<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are forever lost,</span><br />
Unless you pray to Neptune,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not by doubts be tossed.</span><br />
<br />
There is no God but Neptune,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no world but ours,</span><br />
There are no stars, nor planets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There are but sea-weed flowers.</span><br />
<br />
And tilled with consternation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At everything she said&mdash;</span><br />
They even feared pollution,<br />

<br />
He sees no beauty ever,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Except in his own flowers.</span><br />
And if from him you differ,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Contumely on you showers.</span><br />

<p>
What is the future of the race?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I asked a little brook.</span><br />
It laughingly replied to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“I cannot stop to look.”</span><br />
<br />
Then next I asked a gray old tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It shook with laughter too.</span><br />
“Go ask the river, it may give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An answer unto you.”</span><br />
<br />
The river stopped upon its course,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And unto me it said,</span><br />
“Go ask the ocean, it is wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I shall soon him wed.”</span><br />
<br />
The ocean seemed with anger filled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But unto me replied,</span><br />
“I have no time for foolish speech,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do not delay my tide.”</span><br />
<br />
The wind, in answer to my plea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A moment paused, to say,</span><br />
“Go ask the sphinx, perhaps she knows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And will your fears allay.”</span><br />
<br />
I asked the sphinx, she seemed to smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I started back aghast;</span><br />
She seemed to speak, I heard these words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“I only know the past.”</span><br />
<br />
I bowed before the placid stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And begged to know the past.</span><br />
“The present is enough for you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all its questions vast.”</span><br />
<br />
O tell me of the past I beg!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O do not it withhold</span><br />
Sometime the future I shall know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It will to me unfold.</span>

<hr class="tb" /><p>
“O man why seekest thou to know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The future, or the past?</span><br />
The present is enough for you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If not with clouds o’er cast.”</span><br />
<br />
The mountains seemed to pity me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clouds shed showers of tears,</span><br />
The sun looked down in reverence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said: “Allay your fears,”</span><br />
<br />
“For there’s a power that rules mankind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E’er has and ever will.</span><br />

<br />
Then gazing at the works of God,<br />

We’re told that heaven is but for those<br />

If this is true, there is no hope&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No one will ever heaven win.</span><br />
<br />
O where is heaven? an old man cried.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is it above the world’s fierce din?</span><br />
“A still small voice” then spake to him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find your heaven, O look within.</span><br />

A little dove impatient grew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weary of his bars.</span><br />
He longed to break his prison bonds,<br />
And soar among the stars.<br />
<br />
He beat his wings against the bars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vainly tried to break</span><br />
The door of his small prison house.<br />
That freedom he might take.<br />
<br />
For liberty he ever sought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did not love his home.</span><br />
He ever wished that he was free<br />
Around the world to roam.<br />
<br />
The little dove most weary was;<br />

O why should he a prisoner be?<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For liberty he fought.</span><br />

At last with broken, bleeding wings,<br />

For freedom sweet, for liberty,<br />

My soul and I a warfare waged,<br />

Precedence was a law laid down,<br />

I claimed that <em>I</em> was first on earth,<br />

Were one on earth, are one in heav’n,<br />

<p class="center p2">NOTE.</p>

<p class="indent">From the criticism of a friend, I am led to explain myself in regard to
this poem (The Pebble) and some others. What is soul? That which lives
forever&mdash;Well, a pebble disintegrates, and vegetation springs up from
it. Vegetation supports the lower forms of life, which in turn support
the higher, from atom up to God. Life is not matter, though <em>in</em>
all matter&mdash;<em>Life</em>, <em>Soul</em>, goes on through all eternity. God
is in everything that he has created; therefore, <em>everything</em> has
<em>soul</em>.</p>

<p>
Life and Time once ran a race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O’er hills of sorrow and despair.</span><br />
Life often halted by the way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he had many ills to bear,</span><br />
But Time went on, and on, and on.<br />
<br />
Poor Life oft weary was, and worn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oft fell at Time’s unflagging feet.</span><br />
But rose again with strength renewed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And valiantly old Time did greet.</span><br />
Who still went on, and on, and on.<br />
<br />
Though Life oft blinded was by tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discouraged he could never be.&mdash;</span><br />
While Time rushed on to win the race;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Life’s work was for eternity.</span><br />
Yet Time still onward went his way.<br />
<br />
Life cried, O tarry, father Time!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One moment stop in thy mad race;</span><br />
There is so much that I must do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So many problems yet to face.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>Time took no heed, but still rushed on.</span><br />
<br />
Life often staggered ’neath his load,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ever begged that Time would stay.</span><br />
But Time, with scorn upon his brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rushed faster, faster on his way.</span><br />
Went madly on, and on, and on.<br />
<br />
Time had precedence in the race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to Life’s pleadings paid no heed.</span><br />
He cared not for Life’s weariness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor would one point to him concede.</span><br />
But still went on, and on, and on.<br />
<br />
O Time! cried Life, one moment pause!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O stay one moment in your flight,</span><br />
For I am weak, the road is rough;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too soon, too soon comes death’s dark night.</span><br />
Still Time went on, and on, and on.<br />
<br />
Time went his way, nor heeded he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Life was weary, worn, distressed.</span><br />
Life’s burdens all too heavy were;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At every dawn Time was refreshed,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>With courage new went on his way.<br />
<br />
But Life still struggled bravely on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With patience bore his heavy load,</span><br />
And though he often fell by way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the weary upward road,</span><br />
Time took no heed, but still went on.<br />
<br />
Life begged, implored that Time would halt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Time ne’er tarried on Life’s way;</span><br />
But when Life wept, with pitying hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Time stopped to wipe the tears away,</span><br />
And then went on, and on, and on.<br />
<br />
At last Time seemed to fall behind&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Life with joy increased his pace.</span><br />
Time laughed with almost fiendish glee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He knew that Life would lose the race,</span><br />
While he would still go on, and on.<br />
<br />
Poor Life gave up the fight at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He laid his burdens down and died.</span><br />
But still with agonizing voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his last breath to Time he cried.</span><br />
Time took no heed, but still went on.<br />

For all of earthly care?<br />
Wilt thou forgive thy mother<br />
For all that thou must bear?<br />
<br />
In vain is all my pleading&mdash;<br />
Alas! it is too late,&mdash;<br />
For thou must bear life’s burdens,<br />
And thou must meet thy fate.&mdash;<br />
But, angels guard, and keep thee,<br />
This is thy mother’s prayer.<br />
At last to heaven take thee;<br />
To meet thy mother there.<br />

O thou fair daughter of a northern clime!<br />
To thee, dear heart, I dedicate my rhyme.<br />
Dost know that life to thee shouldst be sublime?<br />
<br />
Though thou hast many problems yet to face,<br />
Thou wilt not fall, nor falter in the race.<br />
Nor e’en the smallest thing in life debase.<br />
<br />
“New England” blood is coursing through my veins,<br />
No evil deed, nor thought, thy pure heart stains.<br />
Thy life is melody,&mdash;not sad refrains.&mdash;<br />
<br />
In brightest life, some shadows there will be.<br />
If thou dost bear these shadows cheerfully,<br />
The clouds will break, and sunshine come to thee.<br />
<br />
Not having burdens of thine own to bear,<br />
Thou must be willing others’ griefs to share,<br />
There are enough for all, and some to spare.<br />
If this thou doest uncomplainingly<br />
Thou wilt be blest throughout eternity.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My ship is not prepared to sail;</span><br />
She must be manned with sailors trusty,<br />

Alone I stood upon Life’s landing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The waves to me this message bore:</span><br />
“Thou needst no longer by me loiter.”<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They then receded from the shore.</span><br />
<br />
Upon Life’s shoal I now was stranded;<br />

All hope had with the Tide receded,<br />

A fickle sunbeam fell in love<br />

He scattered sunshine in her path,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tarried in her bower.</span><br />

The little flower returned his love,<br />

For bridal robe on wedding day<br />

And donned a veil of sunshine bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dew-drops for her crown.</span><br />
<br />
Then up the aisle of sunbeams swept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A queen of beauty she.</span><br />
The sunbeam never brighter was.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In gorgeous dress was he.</span><br />

And thought, as he had found his mate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His love would aye endure.</span><br />

But sunbeams are not always true.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In glancing round one day,</span><br />
He saw another little flower,<br />

<br />
His chosen bride deprived of love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon faded, withered, died.</span><br />

Alas for her! His love had cooled;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He hid behind a cloud.</span><br />
He hid his face from his first love<br />

The rose, when born, was purest white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of her beauty never thought.</span><br />
The sun began to smile on her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then a great change in her was wrought.</span><br />

The sun looked down admiringly.<br />

The moss-rose next sprang into life,<br />

So modest was this little rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The public gaze she feared to meet.</span><br />
<br />
She was so timid, and so shy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She hid her face in veil of green;</span><br />
It was a crown of beauty rare,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">More beautiful had never queen.</span><br />

She longed though for companionship.<br />

So chose a mate among the flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then became a bridal rose.</span><br />
<br />
She now ambitious was to rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with disdain looked on the earth;</span><br />
She then sent many tendrils out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then the climbing rose had birth.</span><br />
<br />
She now was filled with greatest pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And struggled hard to reach the skies,</span><br />
But Nature sent her edict forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she no higher e’er should rise.</span><br />
<br />
The rose with anger now was filled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For glancing down upon her bed,</span><br />
She saw a worm coiled ’mong her roots,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then she turned an angry red.</span><br />
<br />
And now was born the bright red rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And though its beauty came from hate.</span><br />
No one disputes its right to reign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A royal queen in regal state.</span><br />

Cold Wisdom was a guest of mine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Pleasure came one day,</span><br />
And she, with almost fiendish glee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drove Wisdom far away.</span><br />

I tried to call chill Wisdom back;<br />

She led me such a merry chase,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I soon seemed past recall.</span><br />
<br />
Then Pleasure seemed to tire of me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And left me worn, distraught.</span><br />
She left me for a fresher field,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never gave one thought</span><br />
<br />
To me, nor to my previous life;<br />

For she had other lives to wreck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had work in pastures new.</span><br />
<br />
For Pleasure has no conscience e’er.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She cares not who may fall</span><br />
So long as she doth have her way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her victims to enthrall.</span><br />
<br />
One need not treat her with disdain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor drive her far away.</span><br />
She often is a welcome guest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If Wisdom too doth stay.</span><br />
<br />
Companions they may even be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though ’tis not always wise</span><br />
For Pleasure to take foremost rank,<br />

A mother mouse with mien most humble<br />
Called to her children&mdash;one and all&mdash;<br />
Revealed to them her sins so many,<br />
That o’er her heart hung like a pall.<br />
<br />
“I must my sins be expiating<br />
Before my life draws to an end.<br />
To convent holy, I will enter,<br />
And my past sins will there amend.”<br />
<br />
“O do not seek me! Do not follow!<br />
Where I am, seek not to know.<br />
Take heed my children to my warning,<br />
For it will save you pain and woe.”<br />
<br />
“Farewell! Farewell! I now must leave you,<br />
Of my <em>advice</em> O pray take heed;<br />
And do not follow my <em>example</em>,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>To grief it surely will you lead.”<br />
<br />
When left alone the little mouselets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were very happy for a while;</span><br />
For mice, like children, are forgetful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They soon forgot their mother’s guile.</span><br />
<br />
They hopped around, all rules forgetting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until their hunger made them think</span><br />
Of their dear mother, their provider,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their eyes with tears then ’gan to blink.</span><br />
<br />
“O let us search for our dear mother;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She may be hungry, cold, or dead.</span><br />
O we will never give up hunting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though we may die with her instead.”</span><br />
<br />
They searched for her in every corner,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In every crevice, every nook.</span><br />
But searched in vain, they could not find her:<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So thought no further they would look.</span><br />
<br />
But they a big round cheese discovered;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It long upon a shelf had lain.</span><br />
“Forsooth we’ll take a little breakfast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our search has not been all in vain.”</span><br />
<br />
All their past searching they found needless;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For snugly housed within the cheese</span><br />
They found their poor repentant mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With conscience very much at ease.</span><br />
<br />
Forgotten was their mother’s <em>teaching</em>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that she for them had borne,</span><br />
They only thought of her <em>example</em>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for her sins they could but mourn.</span></p>


<hr class="tb" /><p>
If you have sins my friends to mourn for,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seek not a cheese to hide within.</span><br />
For surely someone will be seeking,<br />

We give up the battle,<br />

It grew to be a flower of beauty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With col’ring rich and fragrance rare.</span><br />
<br />
It only needed love, and culture<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bring out beauty from its heart;</span><br />
It ever had been timid, shrinking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now it proudly took a part</span><br />
<br />
With other flowers whose birth was higher.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though coming up from out the sod</span><br />
It gave to all sweet ministration,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was a thought, a part of God.</span><br />
<br />
Now if a little weed so humble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A higher place in life could gain</span><br />
By care, and love, and sweet attention,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why not a human weed attain</span><br />

Conditions better, and by struggling,<br />

But <em>it</em> needs help and cultivation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To rise above its seeming fate.</span><br />
<br />
It needs but pruning, needs but watching.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From human weed ’twill rise to be</span><br />
A flower of love, with soul of beauty;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It needs though, <em>love</em> and <em>sympathy</em>.</span><br />
<br />
Though but a weed in Life’s bright garden,<br />

It only needs a new awakening<br />

And thus you will enrich creation,<br />

<br />
I’ll bear my cross whatever it is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No one shall bear a cross for me;</span><br />
And though I bend beneath life’s load,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From selfishness I will be free.</span><br />
<br />
There is a time not distant far,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I can lay life’s burdens down.</span><br />
So many crosses I have borne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last I hope to win Love’s crown.</span><br />

<div class="poetry">
<p>
I’ve travelled down through centuries.<br />
Have never known one moment’s rest.<br />
Have passed through every phase of life.<br />
Is this, O Father, Thy behest?<br />
<br />
I’ve battled with conditions that<br />
Oftimes seemed much too hard to bear,<br />
Would then give up, and seem to sink<br />
Into the maelstrom of Despair.<br />
<br />
Again would take Life’s burdens up<br />
Without a knowledge of my past.<br />
Experience was of little use<br />
In seething whirlpool it seemed cast.<br />
<br />
The same temptations come to us;<br />
As fiends, they ever us pursue.<br />
The consequences are the same.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>We’ve brought down retribution too.<br />
<br />
I still desire to live, to do&mdash;<br />
I am not ready yet to change<br />
My form, my thoughts, my puny life;<br />
E’en though I gain a wider range.<br />
<br />
Absorbed though I may be in Love,<br />
And e’en a part of Deity,<br />
I still am human in <em>desire</em>,<br />
And human still, I wish to be.</p>


<hr class="tb" /><p>
Soul’s Destiny I now take up.&mdash;<br />
Where shall I go? What shall I be?<br />
Shall I aye travel on, and on?<br />
Or be a part of Deity.<br />
<br />
Will memories of the past be mine?<br />
And will a panoramic view<br />
Before mine eyes be ever cast?<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>If so, that past I can but rue.<br />
<br />
Absorbed in God, I lose myself.<br />
I am no part of my <em>own</em> life.<br />
Though one with God, and part of Him,<br />
My soul will still keep up its strife<br />
<br />
To be <em>itself</em>, apart, though with<br />
The Maker, Ruler of my soul.<br />
The <em>Soul’s Desire</em> is not yet dead,<br />
E’en though bright heaven is its goal.<br />
<br />
Though I may carry “Karma” on,<br />
Improve upon it ever, aye;<br />
Could I not do the same, and yet<br />
Not on this weary earth e’er stay?<br />

The notes seem now so strange and weird.<br />

Came from celestial shore.<br />

A vague, vague dream of other lives<br />
Doth often with me stay;<br />

My present life is incomplete.<br />
A fragment is of past.<br />
I shall take up the threads again,<br />

<br />
The “Great First Cause” has charge of<br />
The lives that have been mine.<br />
The web that’s woven on Life’s loom<br />
In time becomes divine.<br />
<br />
Absorbed in God I soon shall be.<br />
E’en now I feel Love’s kiss.<br />
Life’s struggles soon will ended be<br />
In everlasting bliss.<br />
<br />
What was my life in that dim past?<br />
It matters not to me.<br />
My Karma of the past will be<br />
Absorbed in Deity.<br />

Socrates drank of the hemlock;&mdash;<br />

Poison as a draught of hemlock<br />

We may fall, and we may falter.<br />
Life’s battles we may never win.<br />

Others soon will take our places.<br />
Take the love, and take the friendship,<br />
Which was ours by laws most holy,<br />

Faithless friends may give a chalice,<br />
Filled with poison just as deadly,<br />

I’ve stood and fought for centuries past<br />

And hurled their fury on my head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But could not me defeat.</span><br />
<br />
Though generations have passed on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gone to their last rest.</span><br />
I’ve stood the ravages of time,<br />

Of summer’s heat, of winter’s cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lightning’s scorching blast.</span><br />
Unconquered been in nature’s fight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if of iron cast.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes when storms beat on my head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I little cared for life;</span><br />
I would have giv’n the battle up,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all its fierce, fierce strife.</span><br />

And then I felt impelled to say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I’m thankful that God reigns.</span><br />
<br />
Long years ago,&mdash;I count them not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A child on hillside stopped.</span><br />

I soon sprang up from out the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With life and hope so strong.</span><br />
I took my place, have kept it too<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all these centuries long.</span><br />
<br />
For many years the birds have built<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their nests beneath my boughs,</span><br />
Have sung their love songs through the days,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each day renewed their vows.</span><br />

When lover brought to his old home<br />

I’m lonely e’er when they depart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fairer, warmer lands.</span><br />
Impatiently await the time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Love again demands</span><br />
<br />
Their secret nesting ’mong my boughs.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Again I’ll hear Love’s call;</span><br />
Will hear their marriage vows renewed.<br />

In attic bare and dreary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fingers blue with cold,</span><br />
A man sat writing, writing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For pittance small of gold.</span><br />
<br />
His limbs were cramped, and trembling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light was low and dim.</span><br />
For hours he had been writing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Hunger sat by him;</span><br />

Sat even at his elbow<br />

<div class="poetry">
<p>
Vagary is stalking all over the land,<br />
His home is a hut, or a palace most grand.<br />
Whatever his folly, no matter how wild,<br />
Some one will accept it, by it, be beguiled.<br />
<br />
Vagary once built a “Home” on a hill,<br />
And hoped that his dupes his coffers would fill.<br />
This “Home” was a refuge for those in distress,<br />
And, judging by numbers, it was a success.<br />
<br />
He promised a cure for each ache, and each ill.<br />
With lame, halt, and blind, the “Home” did soon fill.<br />
Vagary was doctor, vagary was nurse,<br />
And if at the door stood ever a hearse,<br />
<br />
No comment was made, and it soon disappeared.<br />
Respect had Vagary, and no one e’er sneered.<br />
Vagary was doctor, and if patient he killed<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>No one made remark, and the place was soon filled.<br />
<br />
Vagary discovered an underground mine<br />
Called “Bonnevinterre” a lake of pure wine.<br />
“Like sheep to the slaughter,” the people all rushed,<br />
The mine proved a myth, and their hopes were all crushed.<br />
<br />
Vagary then started a charity scheme,<br />
To write all the bylaws took a full ream<br />
Of “Fool’s Cap” commercial; for written thereon<br />
Were benefits gained, and dividends won.<br />
<br />
“O help the poor widows and orphans” he cried,<br />
And money flowed in on every side.<br />
Vagary was treasurer, and bookkeeper too,<br />
Received all the dividends when they were due.<br />
<br />
The widows got little, the orphans still less,<br />
He ever was talking of their great distress.<br />
Vagary grew richer, and richer each day,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>For charity well managed, ever will pay.<br />
<br />
He next discovered a marvelous light,<br />
Compared to it, e’en the sun was as night.<br />
Directly all other lights became dim,<br />
As usual, the money poured in unto him.<br />
<br />
He now with the highest magnates took rank,<br />
For money he had in every bank.<br />
But magnates, like others, sometime must die,<br />
And in the same earth with poverty lie.<br />
<br />
Vagary grew ill, and gave up the ghost,<br />
But with his last breath he still made the boast<br />
That every ill on earth he could cure.<br />
And even though dying, did many allure.<br />

That able was to bear the test<br />
Of perfect living, perfect love;<br />
E’en in the best it found some flaw;<br />
Some lack of truth, some selfishness;<br />
Not <em>one</em> had kept the “Perfect Law”.<br />
<br />
Discouraged, weary, sore distressed;<br />
It gladly turned again to home.<br />
It thought perfection there to find,&mdash;<br />
No farther it would have to roam.<br />
Alas! Though once more snugly housed,<br />
Perfection was not found therein.<br />
Contented it could never be;<br />

O Soul! Though you have found much sin;<br />
You’ve also found much that was good.<br />
Temptations overcome by man,&mdash;<br />
Known many ills he has withstood.<br />
<br />
Perfection is not found on earth&mdash;<br />
If it were so, no one would know<br />
The joy of helping man to bear<br />
Up under all the grief and woe<br />
That is the heritage of life;<br />
Bequeathed to man before his birth.<br />
Be not discouraged then, O Soul,<br />
Expect to find much sin on earth.<br />

<p>
With careless feet we trample down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love’s sweetest flowers oftimes.</span><br />
Life’s music has so many sharps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discordant are Love’s rhymes.</span><br />
<br />
With selfish hands we ever grasp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At what we think is best.</span><br />
Unmindful we of others’ needs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or what is their behest.</span><br />
<br />
The thoughtless words we oftimes speak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Recalled can never be.</span><br />
The heedless censure of a friend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can ne’er forgotten be.</span><br />
<br />
The unjust judgment which we give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May wean from us a friend.</span><br />
Impatient words are daggers sharp<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That will Love’s heart aye rend.</span><br />
<br />
With selfish greed we grasp life’s joys;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No care for others’ woes.</span><br />
The world is welcome to the thorns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we can keep the rose.</span><br />
<br />
If our own ship outrides the gale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Life’s bar we’ve safely crossed&mdash;</span><br />
All other ships may be engulfed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or on rough waves be tossed.</span><br />
<br />
Our careless words may pierce some heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cause it deepest pain&mdash;</span><br />
Awakening memories of the past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which long in grave have lain.</span><br />
<br />
’Tis ever so in life I fear.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love’s flowers neglected are.</span><br />
The weeds will thrive where flowers die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus Love’s garden mar.</span><br />

To Thee I gave my fragrance&mdash;<br />

I have no rare jewels to give thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No diamonds, no pearls; and of gold</span><br />
But one little circlet, as emblem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That love will thee ever enfold.</span><br />
<br />
Thy home will be only a cottage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And even the floors may be bare.</span><br />
The furnishings be the most simple,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And frugal be also the fare.</span><br />
<br />
The cottage will be by the brookside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By willows so shady and cool.</span><br />
Thy beauty will be e’er reflected<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In mirror that is but a pool.</span><br />
<br />
Thou wilt not be decked in fine linen;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E’en cotton may be all thy gowns.</span><br />
But, love-words will e’er be my greeting,<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kisses take place of dark frowns.</span><br />
<br />
My love is the most I can offer&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will love cover up a bare floor?</span><br />
Or will it fly out of the window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If poverty enters at door?</span><br />
<br />
I know that thy beauty would honor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A palace, instead of a cot.</span><br />
That silks should be e’er thy adorning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But happiness ne’er can be <em>bought</em>.</span><br />
<br />
In palace there <em>can</em> be much sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">’Neath jewels may be broken heart.&mdash;</span><br />
Though clothed in the finest apparel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All naked the wound, and the smart</span><br />
<br />
That comes from a troth that is broken;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That comes from a love that is cold.</span><br />
’Thout love, e’en a palace is dreary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though furnished with jewels, and gold.</span><br />
<br />
Then, darling, take what I can offer&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart filled with love, and my home</span><br />
A nest for my birdling, my sweetheart,<br />

Love’s jewels are better than baubles.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A palace may not be a <em>home</em>;</span><br />
Unhappiness dwelling within it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though jeweled from throne-room to dome</span><br />
<br />
Love’s jewels are all that I ask for;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">True love is more precious than gold,</span><br />
I wish not for palace, nor mansion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thine arms shall me ever enfold.</span><br />
<br />
A sip from Love’s brook is far better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than wine from a gold jeweled cup.</span><br />
’Tis poison in chalice, if Hatred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sits with us at table to sup.</span><br />

My gowns may be cotton, or linen;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It matters but little to me.&mdash;</span><br />
My beauty is not of much value,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless it is pleasing to thee.</span><br />
<br />
The nest thou hast built by the brookside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is better, far better for me</span><br />
Than mansion, or palace, or castle;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No shadow within shall there be.</span><br />
<br />
But echoing songs of thy “birdling”<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall fill every corner, and nook.</span><br />
The willows shall be sylvan bowers;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fountain of love shall be brook.</span><br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
